									<h2>Reflection on Career Aspirations</h2>
									<p>My aspiration is to become a graphic designer in a creative and dynamic environment, where my 
										skills are being used to create visually appealing designs. The graphic design industry provides numerous opportunities 
										for personal and professional development, allowing expressing creativity while satisfying the needs 
										of clients and users. To achieve this goal, a specific plan is made that involves completing my university 
										degree to meet the educational requirements for most design roles. </p>
									<p>By planning to improve my skills in graphic design, it focuses on areas like mastering design software, 
										understanding design principles, and boosting creativity. By already gaining experience with design 
										software like Photoshop during college courses, with unique assets, effectively get me the 
										highest grade possible. I'm willing to explore additional resources and opportunities to enhance
										skills in design software, deepen my understanding of design principles, and enhance creativity. </p>
									<p>Furthermore, teamwork plays a crucial role in graphic design, as working together with colleagues and 
										clients is essential to completing design projects successfully. Design professionals emphasize the 
										importance of collaboration and effective communication in design teams. To improve teamwork abilities, 
										actively engaging in group projects and seeking opportunities to collaborate with peers is undertaken throughout the module.
										 Through these
										 experiences, one aim is to improve teamwork skills and gain insights from different perspectives within the 
										 design community.   </p>
