									<h2>Reflection</h2>
									<p>  Throughout the module, professionalism in IT conduct was included, bringing inspiration from the BCS 
										Code of Conduct. By making attempts to follow ethical values, it was ensured that integrity, 
										honesty, and responsibility were established. Maintaining the confidentiality of sensitive information 
										has been a primary concern, and data has been handled with extreme caution and discretion. Communication 
										skills were also crucial in encouraging cooperation and knowledge sharing within the team and with others. <br><br>

										Furthermore, it highlighted the importance of balancing student and personal life. Prioritizing 
										self-care and well-being are critical to achieving long-term success and fulfilment of a career. By 
										practicing stress-management measures, setting boundaries, scheduling time to relax and engage in 
										leisure activities outside of the module, will help maintaining a healthy work-life balance and 
										safeguard the overall well-being. <br><br>
										
										In addition, the value of professional networking and making important connections in the IT 
										world is crucial. By actively participating in industry events, seminars, and online forums
										 helped on expand my network, share expertise, and keep current on industry trends and best practices.
										   LinkedIn was an effective platform for networking with possible role models, and industry leaders.
										    By keeping an active presence on the platform, established to highlight my abilities, experiences, 
											and accomplishments, effectively establishing them within the IT community. <br><br>

										Also, throughout the module, I have shown excellent professional behaviour by constant and motivated 
										participation, as well as good attendance. My dedication to engaging in labs and seminars not only aided 
										my learning but also improved the overall learning experience. By prioritising attendance and engagement,
										 I have demonstrated my commitment to academic and professional growth.

										To improve professional conduct, more time will be spent on studying and reflection, both individually 
										and in collaboration with colleagues and mentors. By increasing my knowledge of the ethical components
										 of IT practice and the social impact of technology, I hope to maintain a high standard of professionalism 
										 and ethical integrity in my future career.
