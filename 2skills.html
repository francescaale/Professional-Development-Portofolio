									<h2>Evidence of Current Skills</h2>
									<p><u>Website Design and Development Skills</u></p>

									<p>By being involved in the web team working on the Resolve IT website, greatly expanded 
										my skills as a graphic designer. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript hands-on has given me a solid 
										understanding of web design principles. Now, visually appealing and functional web pages are created
										by seamlessly blending graphic elements. Additionally, insights were gained into user experience (UX) design, 
										prioritizing usability and functionality in designs. Combining my web design experience with graphic design, 
										the user requirements can be meet easily. With my expertise in cross-platform design and UX principles, user-friendly 
										designs are created across various digital platforms. By combining my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills with graphic design, 
										provides designs that effectively connect with users and clients.  </p>

									<p> <u>Design Software Skills</u>
									<br><br>By demonstrating my knowledge of design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, 
									    high quality visuals were made for websites through both coursework and personal projects. Throughout studies, 
										Photoshop was used to complete a variety of assignments, which include simple edits to 
										complex designs. Furthermore, projects allowed me to explore the software, resulting in an in-depth knowledge.  </p> 

									<p>Evidence: Completed design projects include creating logos, posters, and digital illustrations using Adobe Creative Suite. 
										Positive feedback from teachers and peers on the quality and creativity of the designs demonstrates my skills in design software. </p>

								    <p><u>Digital Skills</u></p>
								    <p>Doing IDEA's Bronze Award has been a good experience, teaching me skills such as technical knowledge of digital devices, 
										and problem-solving techniques. Throughout the activities, it increased my project management skills, improved communication and 
										teamwork skills, and learnt how to give an effective presentation. Overall, the activities taught patience and adaptability, 
									   providing me with the attitude needed to face problems and succeed in the field of technology.

									</p>

									<p><u>Communication and Collaboration Skills</u></p>
									<p>With experience working with others on presentation projects, has taught important lessons about 
										effective teamwork and communication in the workplace. By actively participating in groups, 
										communicating ideas clearly and listen carefully to the suggestions of others was learned.  By participating in these group activities, 
										confidence was gained in dealing with various team situations and can contribute more effectively.
									</p>
									<p>Evidence: In a group project for my module, collaboration with team members successfully to develop a presentation based 
										on smart devices in education. Our team received positive feedback from our personal tutor for our professionalism, teamwork, 
										and the quality of our final deliverables.  </p>
